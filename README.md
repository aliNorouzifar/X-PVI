## **Introduction**
Traditional process mining techniques often focus on a single event log, limiting their ability to incorporate insights from undesirable behaviors. This tool bridges the gap by integrating desirable and undesirable event logs to improve:
- **Process discovery**: Capturing both ideal and problematic behaviors.
- **Rule-based constraints**: Enhancing interpretability and robustness.
- **Change detection**: Identifying shifts across performance dimensions.

---

## **Features**
- Detect process variability using control-flow change detection.
- Encode event logs into declarative constraints for intuitive analysis.
- Identify behavioral patterns using clustering.
- Visualize and analyze changes in performance metrics.

## **Run with Docker**
If you prefer to run the tool without installing dependencies, you can use the provided Docker image:

1. Pull the Docker image from the GitHub Container Registry:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/alinorouzifar/x-pvi:latest
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8002:8002 ghcr.io/alinorouzifar/x-pvi:latest
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8002/
   ```

The tool will now be accessible without the need to install Python or dependencies on your system.
